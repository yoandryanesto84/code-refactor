User Story
AS A Boot Camp student

I WANT that the codebase given for the first challenge follows accessibility standards

SO THAT the site is optimized for search engines

Things executed
THE source code for HTML and CSS is shown. HTML semantic elements were implemented as: header, main, section, aside and footer. The non-semantic elements as div were replaced by them when applied.
SOME selectors in CSS file were modified because some of them had the same propitiates and values.
A new id was created because in the original index file there was an element in the header without any link that affected the functionality of the page.

Mock-up
The following image shows the web applicationâ€™s appearance:
